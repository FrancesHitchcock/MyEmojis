# My Emojis Scrimba Development

## Background

This project is a development of a simple Scrimba app according to the suggested stretch goals:

- Refactoring JavaScript code and introducing function parameters;
- Adapting the styling including renering the emoji array vertically as a set of list items;
- Employing local storage methods with JSON methods;
- Adding an emoji of the day feature using addEventListener() on a node list so the user can click on an item to render it separately;
- Adding a today's date feature.
